I am currently a Postdoc in the Bioinspired Mateirals and Biosensor Technologies chair at the University of Kiel under Prof. Dr. Zeynep Altintas. I did my Ph.D. with the late Dr. Marilyn Minus of Northeastern University, and my MS with Dr. Sinan Muftu of Northeastern University. I primarily focus on multiscale simulations for polymer nanocomposites, with specific attention on the two ends, molecular dynamics and finite elements. My work seeks to map to experimental data as closely as possible, so that we can better understand the structure-property-processing relationships occuring in our materials.

Here you can find a lot of the tools I have developed / am developing for things like lammps, abaqus, and python.
